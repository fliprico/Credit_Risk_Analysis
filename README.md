# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning skills to evaluate models with unbalanced classes in credit. Due to fact that credit risk is inherently an unbalanced classification problem, different techniques were needed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

## Results

You want to use pipelining with scikit learn from an API or flatfile. A pipeline is one object that does all of your preprocessing work (feature selection, imputation, etc.)

Two evaluation methods: ensemble learning and re-sampling Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier performs the best with our steps & dataset; therefore, we would move forward with this estimator for further predictions.

The oversampling recall score (with SMOTE) has the highest score for predicting both low-risk and high risk loan statuses. We would put forward that this is the best model considering the financial cost risk associated with False Negatives.

Using our knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, weâ€™ll evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. We'll then use the SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier. and EnsembleClassifier algorithms to predict credit risk.
